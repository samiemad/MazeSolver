A simple app to solve mazes.

Project page: https://samiemad.github.io/MazeSolver/

This app can construct maze from the following sources:
* build a new maze in the app
* import an image from gallery
* take an image from the camera

The app then analyse the image to get the maze structure.

After that, it performs a Breadth First Search algorithm to find the actual path and highlights it.
